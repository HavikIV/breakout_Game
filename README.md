# breakout_Game
Just a pratice exercise using the breakout game as the basis for the project

I decided to program the game using C++/CLI in Visual Studio 2015 as it
is what I'm most fimilar with for creating interfaces in C++.

I made the made the pricks, the paddle, and the ball using pictureBoxes.
I also made each one into it's own class so I could create them dynmaically rather than
making from the start and referencing each one dividually when running the collision check.
